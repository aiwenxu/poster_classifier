# Poster Classifier

Use transfer learning to classify posters into genres with pretrained ResNet.

MovieGenre.csv can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-poster/version/3). The poster images are downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-poster/version/3/discussion/35485). We have checked that those poster images correspond to MovieGenre.csv.

### Current Progress:

We have preprocessed the labels into labels.csv.
